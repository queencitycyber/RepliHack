# RepliHack

Currently in beta stage.

RepliHack is a python tool built to be used as a standalone program or with the YouSeeYouHack virtual environment and curriculum.

RepliHack allows you to seamlessly scan a production network using standard NMAP arguments built in, and deploy a near-replica copy into a non-production network.  RepliHack deploys this virtual environment with the help up Vagrant.
